# Explanation of `hautelook.py`

This Python script processes a .csv file containing leaked user data, focusing on cleaning, validation, and filtering records. Below is a step-by-step explanation:

## 1. Import Libraries
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `re`: For regular expression operations.

## 2. Load Data
- The data is loaded from a .csv file using `pandas.read_csv`.

## 3. Initial Exploration
- The script displays the first few rows using `df.head()`.
- It summarizes the dataset's structure and information using `df.info()`.

## 4. Column Renaming
- Placeholder or generic column names are renamed to meaningful labels:
  - Example: `'1@placeholder.xxx'` → `'e_mail'`, `'Unnamed: 1'` → `'password_hash'`.

## 5. Handling Missing Values
- Missing values in columns are replaced with default values:
  - `e_mail`, `firstname`, `lastname`: `'NA'`
  - `zip_code`: `'00000'`
  - `location`: `'XX'`
  - `gender`: `'X'`
  - `birthdate`: `'0001-01-01'` (treated as the minimum valid date).
- Birthdate values are converted to `datetime` using `pd.to_datetime`.

## 6. Name Capitalization
- The `firstname` and `lastname` columns are capitalized unless the value is `'NA'`.

## 7. Duplicate Handling
- Duplicate rows are identified based on the `e_mail` column.
- These duplicate rows are:
  - Saved to a CSV file named `duplicate_rows.csv`.
  - Removed from the main DataFrame.

## 8. Email Validation
- A regex pattern validates email addresses.
- Rows with invalid emails are:
  - Identified and saved to `rows_with_invalid_emails.csv`.
  - Removed from the main DataFrame.

## 9. Combining Invalid and Duplicate Data
- The rows with invalid emails and duplicates are combined into a single DataFrame (`garbage_df`).
- This combined dataset is saved as `garbage.csv`.

## 10. Creating a Final Cleaned Dataset
- Remaining valid rows are reset to a clean DataFrame (`hautelook_cleaned`).
- The cleaned dataset is saved to a file named `hautelook_cleaned.csv`.

## Outputs
### Intermediate Files
1. **`duplicate_rows.csv`**: Contains duplicate rows based on `e_mail`.
2. **`rows_with_invalid_emails.csv`**: Contains rows with invalid email addresses.
3. **`garbage.csv`**: Combines the above two categories.

### Cleaned File
- **`hautelook_cleaned.csv`**: Contains the cleaned dataset with only valid records.

This script ensures the dataset is well-structured, free of duplicates, and contains only valid email addresses, preparing it for further analysis or processing.
